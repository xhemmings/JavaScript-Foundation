# BDPA Foundation JavaScript Learning Series

## Overview

This repository contains a structured learning series designed for **beginner programmers**, particularly for students engaged with the **BDPA Foundation**. These lessons introduce fundamental JavaScript concepts through hands-on exercises and projects, progressing from basic syntax to more advanced topics like loops, conditional statements, and array methods.

## Lessons

Each lesson builds on previous knowledge and includes **explanations, examples, and exercises** to solidify understanding.

### **Lesson 1: Introduction to JavaScript & Variables**

- Understanding `var`, `let`, and `const`
- Declaring and initializing variables
- Simple arithmetic operations

### **Lesson 2: Conditional Statements (if-else & Switch Case)**

- `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements
- Logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`)
- **Grading System Exercise**: User inputs a score, and the program outputs a letter grade.

### **Lesson 3: Loops (for, while, for...of, for...in)**

- Iterating through arrays and objects
- Printing numbers 1-10 using a loop
- **Array Iteration Exercise**: Demonstrate different loop types using a sample array.

### **Lesson 4: Functions and Scope**

- Defining and calling functions
- Function parameters and return values
- **Calculator Exercise**: A simple web-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations.

### **Lesson 5: Advanced Operators & Incremental Operations**

- Using `+=`, `-=`, `++`, `--`
- **Live Input Exercise**: Users enter values, and changes reflect dynamically.

### **Lesson 6: Array Methods (push, pop, shift, unshift, splice, slice)**

- Explanation of common array manipulation methods
- **Interactive Array Exercise**: Users can add and remove elements dynamically.

### **Lesson 7: JavaScript DOM Manipulation**

- Selecting elements with `getElementById()` and `querySelector()`
- Updating text and styling dynamically
- **Practical Exercise**: Modifying content on a webpage using JavaScript.

### **Lesson 8: Pop Quiz (JavaScript Fundamentals Review)**

A **10-question quiz** covering:

- Loops
- Arrays
- Conditional statements
- Functions
- Basic object manipulation

### **Capstone Project: Interactive Web Application** *(Coming Soon!)*

A final project to bring all concepts together.
